# Frontend Developer Take-Home Test: Todo List Application

## Project Overview

Create a Todo List application using React and Vite. You may use TailwindCSS for styling (optional but recommended). This project will assess your ability to build a functional, well-structured application with clean code and good UI/UX principles.

## Requirements

### Technical Stack
- React (with hooks)
- TypeScript (recommended but not required)
- Vite as the build tool

### Core Features
1. **Todo Management**
   - Create new todos with a title and optional description
   - Mark todos as complete/incomplete
   - Edit existing todos
   - Delete todos
   - Filter todos by status (All, Active, Completed)

2. **Data Persistence**
   - Implement local storage to persist todos between browser sessions

3. **UI/UX Requirements**
   - Desktop-focused design (no need to optimize for mobile)
   - Intuitive interface with clear visual feedback for actions

- Due dates for todos with visual indicators for approaching/overdue items
- Categories or tags for todos
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Unit tests for components

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Clean, well-organized code structure
   - Type safety (if using TypeScript)
   - Component composition and reusability
   - State management approach

2. **UI/UX Design**
   - Visual appeal and consistency

   - Intuitive user flow
   - Desktop-optimized interface

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Proper use of React hooks and patterns
   - Project structure and organization
   - Efficient TailwindCSS implementation
   - Code maintainability and readability
